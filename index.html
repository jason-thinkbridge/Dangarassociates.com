                  <b>Dangar Associates</b> is a full-service income tax and accounting firm specializing in small business solutions. We understand that the main focus of the small business owner is running their business. Unfortunately, that means that administrative tasks such as proper bookkeeping or                     keeping up with required governmental documentation sometimes take a backseat to the day-to-day operations of the business.
                <br/>
                <br>
                  <b>Dangar Associates</b> puts Enrolled Agents, Accredited Tax Advisors and Accredited Tax Preparers to work on behalf of you and your business. We not only prepare individual returns but also complex business income tax returns, represent clients before the Internal Revenue Service for                     corporate and individual tax audits, tax liens, payroll tax delinquencies, and the Offer and Compromise tax reduction program.
                </br> 
                
                <br>
                  When you partner with <b>Dangar Associates</b>, you gain a CFO for your company. Whether your business is in need of full-service bookkeeping from invoicing to applying payments and reconciling bank accounts, or if you are simply looking for help with quarterly payroll filings or tax   	                  advice, our flexible menu of services allows us to create a solution for your business that fits both your needs and your budget.
                </br>
                <br>             
                  One of the most important aspects of owning a business is knowing when to delegate tasks so that your time can be spent growing your company.
