                            <p>We are committed to offering a combination of state-of-the-art technology, experience, and understanding of the latest financial developments. Year round service and planning are available.  One of our specialties is providing services for small and medium sized businesses and their owners. Our involvement with business clients usually includes tax and profit planning for their businesses, the owner’s individual income tax returns, and ongoing personal and family financial planning. We would be happy to meet with you to discuss your situation and needs. We also specialize in tax returns for individuals who have complicated financial and tax situations. All tax returns are different and yours will be unique. Our goal is to ensure that your tax returns are prepared accurately and that you pay the lowest amount of taxes possible. Once your yearend bookkeeping is complete our tax professionals will prepare your federal and state tax returns including forms 1120, 1120S, 1065, and 1040 with a Schedule C. If you end up owing more tax than you are able to pay at one time, we can assist you with obtaining installment agreement from both the IRS and the Georgia Department of Revenue.

                  <b>Dangar Associates</b> is a full-service income tax and accounting firm specializing in small business solutions. We understand that the main focus of the small business owner is running their business. Unfortunately, that means that administrative tasks such as proper bookkeeping or                     keeping up with required governmental documentation sometimes take a backseat to the day-to-day operations of the business.
                <br/>

                  <b>Dangar Associates</b> puts Enrolled Agents, Accredited Tax Advisors and Accredited Tax Preparers to work on behalf of you and your business. We not only prepare individual returns but also complex business income tax returns, represent clients before the Internal Revenue Service for                     corporate and individual tax audits, tax liens, payroll tax delinquencies, and the Offer and Compromise tax reduction program.
                </br> 
                
                <br>
                  When you partner with <b>Dangar Associates</b>, you gain a CFO for your company.

                <br>             
                  One of the most important aspects of owning a business is knowing when to delegate tasks so that your time can be spent growing your company.

She has over 30 years of experience in many aspects of corporate accounting, including accurate financial reporting, payroll/1099 processing,     and compiling managerial reports for companies of various sizes.  She is in charge of the day to day operations of the firm, review of all returns, and coordinates bookkeeping and payroll functions.   
                               Prior to joining Dangar Associates, Denise worked for a flooring retailer that liquidated through bankruptcy; she maintained all the books and interacted with attorneys in the lengthy wind down before processing the final distributions to creditors.  She has also consulted on numerous business bankruptcies, compiling the schedules and maintaining the on-going books for the trusts.

From owning a pizza restaurant to running a mortgage company the list of skills she brings to the table is diverse to say the least.  She is known in the office as the queen of       multi-tasking and it isn’t uncommon for her to be on the phone, typing an email, preparing spreadsheets and washing the dishes….all at the same time.  Kim is the gatekeeper for the Bookkeeping and Payroll division.  She is a Certified QuickBooks® ProAdvisor. When she     isn’t saving the world from disorganization you can find her at the football field with her two sons.  Kim lives in Ball Ground with her husband David, sons Jake and Jackson & their two 95lb Newfoundland dogs.

She was raised in Michigan and she is still a Red Wings and Tigers fan.  She raised her two boys in    Indiana and since then they are all spread across the country.  She spends her spare time planning trips to see them.  Since her husband is a ‘car’ guy and has a ’67 GTO, their weekends generally involve going to whatever ‘cruise in’ is being held in the area.  She is    grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the Dangar Associates team working in a profession I have always enjoyed.
